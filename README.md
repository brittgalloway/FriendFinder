## How it Works

## How to Use

First, you will see the home page, where you can enter the survey.
Once on the survey page, you must enter your name, a url link to your photo, and then answer the 10 questions as honestly as possible.

Once you have entered all your data, a modal will pop up with a picture and the name of your best match!
